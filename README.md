# Hi, Iâ€™m Stefan Koch.

**I help people to develope there website.** I believe there's a simpler, more resilient way to make things for the web.

As a freelance web designer and web developer, I optimize websites and perfect user experiences. Since 2013 I vouch for the high quality of Mokorana's services.

> The demands on modern websites are high. A web designer is not a specialist, but a digital decathlete. Visitors expect an attractive design, clear structures, gripping content and short loading times. Of course with the best user experience on all end devices.
